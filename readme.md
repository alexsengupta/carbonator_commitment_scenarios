This folder contains:
JD_projections_pdf*.mat: Each of these files contain 500 model simulations from 1850 to 2100. Simulations span the a priori equilibrium climate sensitivity/ aerosolradiative forcing parameters and cover the four different carbon parameter sets described in the paper. Simulations meet the observed temperature trend constraint.

The /code folder contains matlab scripts to reproduce these simulations (see /code/readme.rtf for more detail)
The /external_data folder conatins forcing data used by the matlab scripts
